This is my first repository on github; I am still learning how to use github.
I want to use the game framework LÃ–VE to make a game with a spaceship that can build and destroy and some other weird things.

I have run into some issues because of my inexperience before but I've solved all bugs, glitches and issues up to this point.
Right now, I have no idea how I could add things such as enemy entities, better ore generation and etc.

What I've accomplished so far:
Moving system
Object and game system
Placing and deleting system
A table of object-related functions
UI objects
Absolutely nothing

I made the sprites in my project myself using Pinta, the sounds are from freesound.org
